Like Foundation, this theme is licensed under the MIT, meaning you can do almost 
anything with it - even sell things you've made with it. The only thing you 
can't do is imply that Guts itself is what you're selling.

You might notice there are no styles here.
This file only registers the theme properly for wordpress and is not 
used at all in the markup.
