# Guts

Guts is a lightweight starter theme for WordPress based on ZURB's Foundation.

> Designed by Rose Mckeon http://github.com/rozeykex

## Guts is a Theme for Developers

I created this theme to give myself a quick starting point for new, bespoke themes. Please feel free to share and contribute or just do whatever you like with this theme. It’s designed as a starting point to build right on top of so there’s no need to create a child theme. Just get the latest guts whenever you start a new WordPress project.

## Demo

You can see the theme in action here: http://guts.rosemckeon.co.uk/

## What's Included

Guts is very basic, but includes everything you need to get started on a new Foundation based WordPress Theme. It uses Foundation 5 and SASS. Stylesheets are setup ready using the SMACCS architecture and all standard main page templates are included. There is a walker class which creates the Foundation Top Bar and a callback function which customises the comments markup. Multiple nav menus and widget areas are ready to use and all functions are well commented.
