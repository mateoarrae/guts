guts

Guts is a developer theme for Wordpress inspired by Roots and Bones. It uses Compass, Sass, Foundation and SMACCS to give you a solid base to your project.
If you love Foundation and Wordpress, I hope you'll love Guts too.

Have it :)


Early Days
----------

I've really only just begun this theme. I hope for it to become a great platform for Foundation lovers to begin
their Wordpress projects more quickly and help them to build better, more organised themes.

Common responsive page layouts provided by Foundation will be included to get your project started quickly.
