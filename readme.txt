Whatâ€™s Included
---------------

Guts is basic, but includes everything you need to get started on a new Foundation based WordPress theme. It uses Foundation 5, Compass and SASS. Stylesheets are setup ready using the SMACSS architecture and all standard main page templates are included. Google fonts are also featured and can be easily updated as well as the Foundation Icon Font. The head is cleaned up from all the usual WordPress clutter and all functions are well commented.
